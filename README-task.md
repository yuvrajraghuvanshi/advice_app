# Advice generator app

## The task

Your task is to build out this advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a random piece of advice by clicking the dice icon
- You have 30 minutes to complete the task
- You should strictly use HTML, CSS and vanilla JS to complete the task
- You are required to submit the link of your hosted GitHub repository and the URL of the completed project.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
